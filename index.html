        <p>Colombian since 29 years ago, Petroleum Engineer from Universidad Nacional de Colombia, 
            living in Chicago three years ago. I really enjoy technology, I remember when I was a child
            how my father had a computer in his house and how the curiosity was into me.</p>

        <p>I have lived in many places in Colombia, my favorite is Medellin because  is a big town
            where the culture in people is very genreous. I find in Chicago the same human behavior 
            that I found in Medellin, is for that I feel I am in home.
        </p>

        <p>I was raised with my mom and my brother. Frecuently we were to my father house to share time
            with my other sibblings. All we shared time with video games, between all we I was the better. 
            Since there, I had been interested to develop my skills with technology.
